These are the steps I use to make a release:
-update the version number to the correct number.  Right now, there are 3 places to do that:
speckle/__init__.py
docs/conf.py
setup.py

- make sure you have a clean tree (ie: no uncommitted stuff), or clone a new copy of the tree.
- install the library (python setup.py build; sudo python setup.py install)
- go to docs/, run `make html` (This needs to be done on a system with GPU support, such as phaser or magnon)
- copy these docs to phaser and keoki.org
- run `python setup.py sdist --format=zip
