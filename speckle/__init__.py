""" A speckle correnation library for Beamline 12.0.2 at the Advanced Light
Source at Lawrance Berkeley National Laboratory. This library contains
functions that allow the user to analyze data from experiments conducted at
the ALS. This includes magnetic memory, rotational symmetries, imaging, near
field propagation, and x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy.
