0.5 - 10/2/2012
- support for fitting with weighted values in all fit functions
- support for fitting lists of data as well as arrays
- new module for permuting lists
- Make the documentation better overall

0.4 - 8/9/2012
- implement the random sampling and consensus (RANSAC) algorithm for fitting data.
- add a fit function, lorentzian_sq that's blurred with a gaussian.  This is a reasonably good line shape for fitting labyrinth domains.
- Remove reliance on our own `hacked' pyfft.
- Fix bugs.

0.3 - 7/26/2012
- Implement a testing framework to test the module
- Add a GPU accelerated medianfilter
- Continue to add examples.  Some have GUIs
- Fix lots of bugs.

0.2 - July 16, 2012
- add a new library, speckle.masking, related to masking of pixels.
- added a center-finding function, speckle.conditioning.find_center().
- implement donut Lorentzian, Gaussian, and Lorentzian square fit functions.
- speed up merging algorithms by rewriting them without distance_map.
- improve documentation and readability of many modules.
- Fix lots (~100) of bugs.

0.1 - July 9, 2012
- Initial release.
