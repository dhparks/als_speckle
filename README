Speckle is a module for analyzing data from the coherent scattering beamline
12.0.2 at the Advanced Light Source.

Python library dependencies:
    1. numpy, scipy, pyfits
    2. (optional for gpu algorithms) pyopencl, pyfft
    3. (optional for configuration finding) networkx, community (aka python-louvain)
    4. (optional for images) Image (aka PIL)

Features of the library:
    * Analyze X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy datasets
    * Fit 1d (x,y), 2d and 3d (image) datasets to many functions (decayed
        exponentials, Lorentzians, Gaussians)
    * Phase retrieval and data conditioning with GPU support
    * Unwrapping and wrapping centrosymmetric data
    * Rotational symmetry analysis
    * Q-dependent (rotational) and spatial memory analysis
    * Registering and merging of data for imaging
    * Simulations of single-photon XPCS data, domain generation, and random walks
    * Endstation-specific items such as Q-calculations and conversion from
        detected events to photons

To install the library make sure that the dependencies (numpy, scipy, pyfits, and
optionally Image, PyOpenCL, PyFFT, NetworkX, and community) are installed.
A great python distribution to use for python development is Enthought's EPD
free (http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php). It contains a large amount of
libraries including numpy and scipy.

To install speckle, unzip the file and in the directory run:
    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install
