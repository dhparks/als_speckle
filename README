Speckle is a module for analyzing data from the coherent scattering beamline 12.0.2 at the Advanced Light Source.  The module requires numpy and scipy modules, and it has GPU support when PyOpenCL and PyFFT are installed.


Features of the library:
    * Analyze X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) datasets
    * Fit 1d (x,y), 2d and 3d (image) datasets to many functions (decayed exponentials with beta parameter, Lorentzians, Gaussians)
    * Phase retrieval and data conditioning with GPU support
    * Unwrapping and wrapping centrosymmetric data
    * Rotational symmetry analysis
    * Q-dependent (rotational) and spatial memory analysis
    * Registering and merging of data for imaging
    * Simulations of single-photon XPCS data, domain generation, and random walks
    * Endstation-specific items such as Q-calculations and conversion from detected events to photons


To install the library, run

    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install
