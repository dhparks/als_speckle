Speckle is a module for analyzing data from the coherent scattering beamline
12.0.2 at the Advanced Light Source.  The module requires numpy, scipy and
pyFITS modules, and it has GPU support when PyOpenCL and PyFFT are installed.

Features of the library:
    * Analyze X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy datasets
    * Fit 1d (x,y), 2d and 3d (image) datasets to many functions (decayed
        exponentials, Lorentzians, Gaussians)
    * Phase retrieval and data conditioning with GPU support
    * Unwrapping and wrapping centrosymmetric data
    * Rotational symmetry analysis
    * Q-dependent (rotational) and spatial memory analysis
    * Registering and merging of data for imaging
    * Simulations of single-photon XPCS data, domain generation, and random walks
    * Endstation-specific items such as Q-calculations and conversion from
        detected events to photons


To install the library make sure that the dependcies (numpy, scipy, pyfits, and
optionally PyOpenCL and PyFFT) are installed. A great python distribution to use
for python development is Enthought's EPD free (http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php).
It contains a large amount of libraries including numpy and scipy.

To install speckle, unzip the file and in the directory run:
    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install
